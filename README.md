# Super-Scheduler
### Introduction
A Java program that can take times, courses, and priority numbers inputted from the user and create a time table with no overlap. A solution for making time tables and struggling to find a schedule with desired courses.

### Inspiration
I was inspired to begin this coding project because I always found myself stressed when course registration came around. Trying to fit five courses and their labs into a time table that worked best for me and was compatible with the courses I wanted to take seemed like a truly impossible task. Not only this, but this task was extremely time consuming! Thus spawned the Super Scheduler.

### Next steps
I am working on creating a visual component, where after the program gives the user a schedule, it shows it on a week view calendar (similar to a view you would find on Google Calendar). I also hope to allow the program to show multiple variants of the schedule at one point, instead of just one calendar.

This program asks the user for course information, a priority list, and the earliest/latest they would like to stay on campus. Of course, some schedules are *actually* impossible to craft. If the program detects a schedule that does not work, it will alert the user.
